# About the dataset
Predicting Airbnb Prices in the United States The project aims to analyze and predict the prices of Airbnb listings across different cities in the United States. The data utilized for this project is obtained from Inside Airbnb, specifically from the website http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/.

# Project objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of an Airbnb listing based on various features such as location, property type, amenities, and reviews. By leveraging the available dataset, we can analyze the factors that significantly influence the pricing of Airbnb accommodations in different regions of the United States.

# Methodology
The project will utilize machine learning techniques to build an accurate and reliable predictive model. By training the model 'CatBoots Regressor' on the Inside Airbnb dataset, we aim to provide users with a tool that can assist in estimating Airbnb prices in the United States. This project has the potential to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the short-term rental market and contribute to the broader understanding of the factors influencing Airbnb pricing strategies.

# Demo
We demo our model by a streamlit app, with input features such as bedroom type, number of bedrooms, amenities, reviews score,... and make predictions about the most suitable price given these parameters.
